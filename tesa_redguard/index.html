      <h2>Route Outline</h2>
      <p>This is the outline I used for my run. It includes gold gains/expenditures, maps, optimal dialogue, item usage points, etc.</p>

      <h2>Tricks</h2>
      <h3>Teleporter Skip - Solitaan</h3>
      <p>There is a cycle of 3 teleporters and normally you must complete all of Goblin Caverns to unlock the last one. However, a very precise jump allows you to escape the cage and skip 14 minutes of the dungeon, including some of the hardest platforming in the game.</p>
      <h3>Run Door Clip - Solitaan</h3>
      <p>In the Catacombs, you must complete three platform areas to get three runes, which you can then use to solve a puzzle and open a door. It is possible to skip all of that (9 minutes) by clipping by the door. This requires the combination of a correct standing position and angle, plus taking out your sword.</p>
      <h3>Scarab Puzzle Skip - Don Bennett</h3>
      <p>In the Dwarven Ruins, a Scarab puzzle must be solved to open the door to the Pipes area. This puzzle is very finicky and long. A fairly easy jump allows you to get on the sides of the ramp and walk up above the level, where you can jump behind the door and continue. Found by Don Bennett.</p>
      <h3>Canopy Jump/Gate Clip - Solitaan</h3>
      <p>During casual play I somehow reached the bottom of the Old Quarter without dying; I later found out you don't take damage if you hit a wall after jumping on a Canopy. That trick, in addition to a fairly easy clip at the gate, allows for more consistency/speed. Either trick would be useless without the other. I had more trouble with the gate than normal this time.</p>
      <h3>Fast Flask - Solitaan</h3>
      <p>There are five map pieces that lead to the Flask of Lillandril, and in previous runs I got all of them because the Flask did not appear otherwise. Through more tests, I determined that only two of the pieces are required for it to appear, which skips lots of slow dialogue etc. throughout the run.</p>
      <h3>N'Gasta Skip - Solitaan</h3>
      <p>You can skip the fight with N'Gasta by jumping over the trigger area. I failed it a couple times and it only saves about a minute, but I still came out slightly ahead.</p>
      <h3>Fast Rings</h3>
      <p>Typically a lever is pulled which makes three large rings turn alternately. The third ring contains another lever that opens a path to the bottom. It is much easier, and somewhat faster, not to make the levels turn and instead to go through the puzzle in an unintended way.</p>
