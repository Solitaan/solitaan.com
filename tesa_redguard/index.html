      <h2>Glitches</h2>
      <h3>Teleporter Skip - Solitaan (2018)</h3>
      <p>There is a cycle of 3 teleporters in Goblin Caverns and normally you must complete the entire dungeon to unlock the last one. However, a very precise jump allows you to escape the cage and skip 14 minutes of the dungeon, including some of the hardest platforming in the game.</p>
      <h3>Run Door Clip - Solitaan (2018)</h3>
      <p>In the Catacombs, you must complete three platform areas to get three runes, which you can then use to solve a puzzle and open a door. It is possible to skip all of that (9 minutes) by clipping through the wall next to the door. This requires the combination of a correct standing position and angle, plus taking out your sword.</p>
      <h3>Scarab Puzzle Skip - Don Bennett (2002)</h3>
      <img src="images/time_stats_all.png" alt="Scarab Puzzle Skip">
      <p>In the Dwarven Ruins, a Scarab puzzle must be solved to open the door to the Pipes area. This puzzle is very finicky and long. A fairly easy jump allows you to get on the sides of the ramp and walk up above the level, where you can jump behind the door and continue.</p>
      <h3>Canopy Jump/Gate Clip - Solitaan (2018)</h3>
      <p>During casual play I somehow reached the bottom of the Old Quarter without dying; I later found that you don't take damage if you hit a wall after jumping on a Canopy.</p>
      <p>There is also a fairly easy clip at the gate, by getting into the west corner of the gate, facing south, taking 3 steps back, and jumping forward.</p>
      <p>The combination of these two tricks allows for more consistency/speed. Either trick would be useless without the other.</p>
      <h3>N'Gasta Skip - Solitaan (2018)</h3>
      <p>You can skip the fight with N'Gasta by jumping over the trigger area. This only saves about 1 minute when done optimally.</p>
      <h3>Fast Rings - Solitaan (2018)</h3>
      <p>In the Catacombs, typically a lever must be pulled start the roration of three large rings. The third ring contains another lever that opens a path to the bottom. It is much easier, and somewhat faster, to leave the rings stationary and instead go through the puzzle in an unintended way.</p>
